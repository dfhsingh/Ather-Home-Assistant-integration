# Ather Energy Home Assistant Integration (Deprecated)

### **Project Status: Discontinued**

As of **January 29, 2026 (18:16:39 IST)**, Ather Energy has implemented server-side restrictions that prevent unofficial applications and third-party integrations from accessing their APIs.

Consequently, this Home Assistant custom component—along with many other community-driven tools—is no longer functional.

### **Why this repository was removed**

Maintaining an open-source integration for a closed API presents security risks. While the required identifiers were not user passwords, they are sensitive credentials that trigger security flags (including GitHub's secret scanning).

To protect the integrity of the community and adhere to security best practices, I have decided to stop development and have removed the original repository. This repository now exists solely to document this status.

### **A Request to the Ather Team**

If members of the Ather Energy team are reading this:

The community of Ather owners includes many enthusiasts and developers who love your hardware. We believe that **official, documented APIs** (with proper OAuth2 protocols, security tokens, and rate limiting) would significantly enhance the ownership experience.

Please consider opening your platform to developers so we can help make Ather scooters even more "intelligent" and "awesome."
