## **Ather Energy Home Assistant Integration**

### **⚠️ Status: Discontinued / Deprecated**

As of **January 29, 2026 (18:16:39 IST)**, Ather Energy has implemented server-side restrictions that prevent unofficial third-party integrations from accessing their APIs. Consequently, this Home Assistant custom component is **no longer functional**.

### **Why this repository was removed**

Maintaining an open-source integration for a closed, undocumented API presents significant security risks. The credentials required to bypass these restrictions often trigger security flags and sensitive data warnings.

To prioritize user security and adhere to best practices, development has ceased and the original codebase has been removed. This repository now serves as a historical record and status update.

### **Project Backstory: Why it was created**

Managing over 20 battery-powered devices is a maintenance challenge for me. The goal was to centralize monitoring within **Home Assistant** to receive timely charging and replacement alerts without relying on a dozen individual apps.

Specifically for the Ather, the intent was to implement **smart charging routines** to prolong battery health and integrate the scooter into a unified smart home dashboard.

### **A Request to the Ather Energy Team**

The Ather community includes a vibrant group of developers and enthusiasts who want to enhance their ownership experience.

We believe that **official, documented APIs**—utilizing industry-standard OAuth2 protocols and secure token management—would make Ather scooters even more "intelligent" and "awesome." Please consider opening your platform to the developer community.
