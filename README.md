Just after 2026-01-29T18:16:39 IST, Ather successfully enforced restrictions on their Servers.

As a result all un-official apps/integrations stopped working.
including my Home Assistant integration custom_component.


Due to the open-source nature of home assistant custom components, 
Its risky to keep the code published along with the required keys, 
although they are not tokens/password, but are sensitive details, and rightfully gets flagged by Github.

I am no more pursuing this and have removed the old repo.
this new repo created just for this README :)
